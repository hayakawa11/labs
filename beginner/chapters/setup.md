### Prerequisites

There are no specific skills needed for this tutorial beyond a basic comfort with the command line and using a text editor. Prior experience in developing web applications will be helpful but is not required. As you proceed further along the tutorial, we'll make use of [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

### Setting up your computer
Getting all the tooling setup on your computer can be a daunting task, but thankfully getting Docker up and running on your favorite OS has become very easy.

The *getting started* guide on Docker has detailed instructions for setting up Docker on [Mac](http://docs.docker.com/mac/step_one/), [Linux](http://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/) and [Windows](http://docs.docker.com/windows/step_one/).

Once you are done installing Docker, test your Docker installation by running the following:
```
$ docker run hello-world

...

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

...
```
