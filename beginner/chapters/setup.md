### Prerequisites

There are no specific skills needed for this tutorial beyond a basic comfort with the command line and using a text editor. Prior experience in developing web applications will be helpful but is not required. As you proceed further along the tutorial, we'll make use of <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>.

### Setting up your computer

Getting all the tooling setup on your computer can be a daunting task, but thankfully getting Docker up and running on your favorite OS has become very easy.

The *getting started* guide on Docker has detailed instructions for setting up Docker on <a href="https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/installation/mac/" target="_blank">Mac</a>, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/installation/linux/" target="_blank">Linux</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/v1.11/engine/installation/windows/" target="_blank">Windows</a>.

Once you are done installing Docker, test your Docker installation by running the following:
```
$ docker run hello-world

...

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

...
```
